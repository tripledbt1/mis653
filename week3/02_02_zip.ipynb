    "### 🧭 Overview — Understanding the `zip()` Function in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll explore how the **`zip()`** function works in Python.  \n",
    "The `zip()` function is used to combine (or \"pair\") elements from two or more sequences, such as lists or tuples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you iterate over a zipped object, Python pairs the first elements together, then the second elements, and so on — just like zipping the teeth of a zipper.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- We have two lists: `points_game1` and `points_game2`, which contain scores for five players in two different games.\n",
    "- We'll use `zip()` to iterate through both lists simultaneously.\n",
    "- We'll calculate the **absolute difference** between each player’s scores and store the results in a new list called `diffs`.\n"
